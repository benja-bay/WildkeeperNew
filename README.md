# Wildkeeper

Wildkeeper is a 2D pixel art Zeldalike game where you take on the role of a ranger whose workday in Patagonia takes an unexpected turn: visitors and animals have disappeared, and itâ€™s your duty to uncover why. Using your tranquilizer weapons, tools, and knowledge, you will explore until you realize the danger lurking there: mutations threaten to take over the park, expand, and destroy everything.
